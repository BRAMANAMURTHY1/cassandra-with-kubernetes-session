In Apache Cassandra, a `UUID` (Universally Unique Identifier) is a type of data used to uniquely identify information in distributed systems like Cassandra. Cassandra, being a distributed database, often requires a unique way to identify records or data elements to ensure that they are distinct across multiple nodes in a cluster. `UUID`s fulfill this requirement.

There are two main types of UUIDs used in Cassandra:

1. **Time-Based UUID (Type 1 UUID):** This form of UUID includes a timestamp component, which helps in ordering the UUIDs based on the time they were generated. This can be particularly useful for time-series data or applications where temporal ordering is important.

2. **Random UUID (Type 4 UUID):** This is a randomly generated UUID and does not contain a time component. It's purely based on random numbers and provides a very high level of uniqueness.

UUIDs are commonly used as primary keys in Cassandra tables because they ensure that each row is unique and can be distributed evenly across the cluster. This is essential for achieving high performance and scalability in distributed database systems.

Cassandra provides built-in functions to generate UUIDs, making it easy for developers to create and use them in their applications. The choice between a time-based UUID and a random UUID depends on the specific requirements of the application and the data model.
