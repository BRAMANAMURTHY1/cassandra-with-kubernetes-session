To implement Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) in Apache Cassandra, you need to configure snapshots, commit log archiving, and understand the commands for backing up and restoring data. Here are the key steps with examples:

### 1. **Enable Commit Log Archiving**
   - Edit the `cassandra.yaml` configuration file. This file is typically found in the `conf` directory of your Cassandra installation.
   - Add or update the following lines:
     ```yaml
     commitlog_archiving_enabled: true
     commitlog_archive_command: "cp %path /path/to/commitlog_archive"
     commitlog_restore_command: "cp /path/to/commitlog_archive/%name %path"
     commitlog_archiving_retry_interval: 10 # in seconds
     ```
   - Replace `/path/to/commitlog_archive` with your desired archive location.

### 2. **Taking Snapshots**
   - To create a snapshot for all keyspaces:
     ```
     nodetool snapshot
     ```
   - For a specific keyspace:
     ```
     nodetool snapshot mykeyspace
     ```
   - These commands will create snapshots stored in the `snapshots` subdirectory of the data directory for each keyspace.

### 3. **Automating Snapshots**
   - You can use a cron job to automate the snapshot process.
   - Example cron entry for daily snapshots at 2 AM:
     ```
     0 2 * * * /path/to/cassandra/bin/nodetool snapshot
     ```

### 4. **Restoring from a Snapshot**
   - First, identify the snapshot to restore. Snapshots are located in the `data_directory/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/snapshots` directory.
   - Stop the Cassandra node.
   - Clear the data from the table's data directory:
     ```
     rm -rf /path/to/data_directory/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/*
     ```
   - Copy the snapshot data into the tableâ€™s data directory:
     ```
     cp /path/to/data_directory/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/snapshots/snapshot_name/* /path/to/data_directory/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/
     ```
   - Restart the Cassandra node.

### 5. **Replaying Commit Logs**
   - After restoring from a snapshot, you may need to replay commit logs to recover data up to a specific point in time.
   - Stop the Cassandra service.
   - Move the necessary commit log files from the archive location to the commit log directory.
   - Start Cassandra. It will automatically replay the commit logs.

### 6. **Cleanup After Restoration**
   - Once the system is restored and verified, clear old snapshots to save space:
     ```
     nodetool clearsnapshot
     ```

### 7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Regularly monitor the storage used by snapshots and commit log archives.
   - Implement a policy to delete old backups based on your data retention requirements.

### Important Notes
- Always test your backup and restoration process in a non-production environment first to ensure it works as expected.
- The paths and configurations might vary based on your Cassandra setup and operating system.
- Ensure that the Cassandra version and configuration are consistent across backups and restorations to avoid compatibility issues.
- For large datasets, consider the impact on performance and plan the backup and restoration during low-traffic periods.

Implementing PITR in Cassandra requires careful planning and regular testing. Make sure your team is familiar with the process and prepared for potential data recovery scenarios.
