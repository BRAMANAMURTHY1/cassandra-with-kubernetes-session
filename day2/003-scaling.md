Vertical and horizontal scaling are key concepts in the field of computer science, particularly in the context of system architecture and cloud computing. 

1. **Vertical Scaling**: Also known as "scaling up," this involves adding more resources to an existing server. Typically, this means upgrading the CPU, RAM, or storage of a single machine to increase its capacity. It's akin to upgrading a PC from a dual-core to a quad-core processor, or adding more RAM. Vertical scaling usually has limits based on the maximum capacity of the hardware.

   ```

2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Also known as "scaling out," this approach involves adding more machines to your setup or network to distribute the load. Unlike vertical scaling, where you expand the capacity of a single machine, horizontal scaling spreads out the demand across multiple machines, like adding more servers to a web server cluster. This is often used in cloud computing where you can add more instances as needed.

       A[Server 1] --> C[Load Balancer]
       B[Server 2] --> C
       D[Server 3] --> C
       E[New Server] --> C
   ```
